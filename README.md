# Network Topology Simulation

This repository contains the network topology simulation for the new engineering building at the Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos√© de Caldas. The simulation is created using Cisco Packet Tracer and includes the network configuration details in a LaTeX document.

## Contents

- `topology.pkt`: The Cisco Packet Tracer file containing the network topology simulation.
- `Network_Topology_Documentation.tex`: The LaTeX document detailing the network topology, configurations, and setup procedures.
- `Network_Topology_Documentation.pdf`: The compiled PDF version of the LaTeX document.

## How to Use

1. **Packet Tracer File**:
    - Open `topology.pkt` using Cisco Packet Tracer to explore the network topology simulation.
    - This file includes the configurations for VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP setup, and access point configurations.

2. **LaTeX Documentation**:
    - The `Network_Topology_Documentation.tex` file contains a detailed explanation of the network design and configurations.
    - You can compile the LaTeX file to generate a PDF document using a LaTeX editor or an online LaTeX editor like Overleaf.
    - The compiled PDF (`Network_Topology_Documentation.pdf`) is also included for convenience.
